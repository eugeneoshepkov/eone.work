Music has been my parallel track to engineering: same iteration loop, same obsession with craft, same “this is fine” moment right before you decide to redo the whole thing.

## Exage (2010–2019) — Modern Metal / Metalcore

I played as a singer + guitarist. We recorded an album and filmed several music videos.

## Harvard Process — one-man Progressive Metal

This was my “personal sandbox”: writing, recording, and mixing without a band around me.

## Discrepancy — Melodic Metal

Another band chapter where I was on vocals.

## Caspian Ghost — AI-assisted experiments (Russian lyrics)

Recently I’ve been experimenting with AI music as a fast sketchpad. I use Russian lyrics to make it more personal.
