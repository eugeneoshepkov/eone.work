I grew up in Aktau, Kazakhstan - a desert city on the Caspian Sea that only exists because of a nuclear reactor.

At 18 I moved to Saint Petersburg for engineering school. I knew no one. The first years were rough.

But I'd already found two things that kept me going: programming and music.

## Programming

I got hooked at 14. You write a few lines, the computer does something it couldn't do before. That was enough to keep me at it for hours.

## Music

A year later I picked up guitar. No lessons. I taught myself guitar, singing, and techniques I probably should've learned "properly". At some point I figured out how to do metal screaming on inhale.

I was bad for a long time. But being bad in public taught me to experiment without protecting my ego.

## Starting from zero

No network. No momentum. Just a huge city and a lot of free time between classes.

I filled it with small software projects. Not impressive, not portfolio-perfect. Just things that shipped. Over time that compounds into a career.

## Now

Today I'm based in Vienna. Married, two kids.

I like building things that ship and survive real users. I apply the same approach outside work too - I'm pretty data-driven about health, tracking what works and dropping what doesn't.

## If you’re in your “start from zero” phase

If you’re in a new city. Or switching careers. Or feel late.

You don’t need a grand plan.

You need a loop you can repeat:

- Pick one thing you genuinely care about
- Build something small
- Ship it
- Notice what broke (in the thing and in you)
- Adjust

That’s how I got from Aktau to Vienna.
