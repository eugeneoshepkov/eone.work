I grew up in Aktau, Kazakhstan.

At 18 I moved to Saint Petersburg to study engineering. I didn’t know a single person in the city.

Those were the hardest years in my life.

They also shaped how I learn and build: small loops, fast feedback, no magic.

## Programming was my first obsession

I got hooked on programming at 14.

The feeling was addictive: you write a few lines, the computer does something it couldn’t do before. Instant feedback. Instant failure too.

That loop stuck with me. Break it. Fix it. Repeat.

## Music hit with the same force

A year later I got obsessed with music the same way.

No formal education. I taught myself guitar, singing, and a lot of techniques I probably should’ve learned “properly”. At some point I even figured out how to do metal screaming on inhale.

I was bad for a long time. And I had to hear it.

That was the point.

Being a rookie in public taught me to experiment without protecting my ego.

## Moving cities is a migration with no rollback

Moving to Saint Petersburg at 18 wasn’t romantic.

It was me, a huge city, and zero social surface area.

I didn’t have a network. I didn’t have momentum. I had to build both while studying.

I learned to treat “hard years” like a system problem:

- Reduce scope until you can move
- Build routines that don’t rely on motivation
- Put yourself in places where feedback is real

## My career started as tiny, unsexy projects

While studying and doing music, I started building small software projects.

Not impressive. Not portfolio-perfect. Just things that shipped.

Each one did two jobs:

- It taught me something concrete
- It proved to me I could finish

Over time that compounds into a career.

## I still run on feedback loops

Today I’m based in Vienna.

I work like I always have: clarity, constraints, iteration. I like building things that ship and survive real users.

I also apply the same mindset outside work. I’m pretty data-driven about health: I track, I run boring experiments, I keep what works. It’s the same loop again.

I’m married, I have two kids, and it’s the best constraint I’ve ever had. It forces me to cut the noise.

## If you’re in your “start from zero” phase

If you’re in a new city. Or switching careers. Or feel late.

You don’t need a grand plan.

You need a loop you can repeat:

- Pick one thing you genuinely care about
- Build something small
- Ship it
- Notice what broke (in the thing and in you)
- Adjust

That’s how I got from Aktau to Vienna.
