Hey — welcome.

I’m Evgeny Oshchepkov. I build web products where “engineering” and “product” collide: public APIs, developer experience, performance, and the messy parts of shipping.

## Who I am

Product-minded Software Engineer (10+ years), currently based in Vienna. I like work that’s equal parts architecture and pragmatism: ship fast, don’t break users, and keep the codebase sane.

Outside work I make music — mostly self-taught since I was 15 — and it’s where I learned to be comfortable shipping ugly drafts and iterating fast.

## What I do

My day-to-day is mostly:

- **Building SDKs** — public APIs, versioning, docs, ergonomics
- **AI integrations** — LLM features that survive real users and real data
- **Technical leadership** — mentoring, reviews, raising the bar without slowing teams down
- **Performance optimization** — making things fast, then preventing regressions

## What to expect here

This blog will cover:

- TypeScript patterns and React architecture
- Shipping AI-powered features without turning your app into a demo
- Migration playbooks (technical and human)
- Developer experience and tooling

If you want a starting point:

- [Design Systems Are Just Good Constraints](/blog/design-systems)
- [What I Learned Shipping LLM Features to Production](/blog/llm-production-lessons)
- [The Art of Migrating Legacy Systems Without Losing Your Mind](/blog/migrating-legacy-systems)
