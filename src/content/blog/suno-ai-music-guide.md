I've spent an embarrassing amount of time on Suno. What started as curiosity about AI music generation turned into a genuine creative outlet. After a few hundred generations, a few patterns consistently beat “a sad song about love”.

## The prompt is everything

Most people write prompts like "a sad song about love." That gets you exactly what you'd expect — forgettable, generic output. The magic is in specificity.

**Bad prompt:**
> A rock song about being tired

**Better prompt:**
> Gritty garage rock, lo-fi recording, tired vocals, 3am energy, simple power chords, drums slightly behind the beat, about exhaustion from endless work

The second prompt gives Suno texture, mood, and sonic character to work with.

If you’re stuck, start with this template and fill the brackets:

> [subgenre], [recording/production style], [vocal style], [key instruments], [energy curve], [era/reference], [imperfection cue], [one-line story]

## Structure your lyrics like a songwriter

Suno understands song structure. Use tags to guide it:

```
[Verse 1]
Lines about your specific story
Keep it concrete, avoid abstractions

[Pre-Chorus]
Build tension here

[Chorus]
Your hook — make it memorable and singable

[Verse 2]
Develop the narrative

[Bridge]
Change perspective or introduce a twist

[Outro]
Resolve or leave it hanging
```

The `[Instrumental]` and `[Break]` tags are your friends for adding breathing room.

## Genre-specific tricks

### For electronic/synth music
- Mention specific synth types: "analog pads," "acid bassline," "plucky arpeggios"
- Reference eras: "80s synthwave," "90s trance breakdown"
- Describe the energy curve: "building tension," "euphoric drop"

### For rock/indie
- Production style matters: "bedroom recording," "stadium production," "DIY punk"
- Mention guitar tones: "jangly clean," "fuzzed out," "twangy telecaster"
- Vocal style: "whispered verses," "shouted chorus," "harmonized"

### For hip-hop/R&B
- Beat descriptions: "boom bap drums," "trap hi-hats," "neo-soul keys"
- Flow references: "laid-back flow," "double-time verse"
- Vibe words: "late night," "confident," "introspective"

## The engineer's approach to iteration

Here's where my software background helps. I treat Suno like any other system:

1. **Start with a hypothesis** — What specific sound am I going for?
2. **Test one variable at a time** — Change the genre descriptor, keep lyrics the same
3. **Save your winners** — Build a personal library of prompts that work
4. **Extend what works** — Use the extend feature on promising generations

I keep a notes file with successful prompt patterns. It's basically prompt engineering, but for music.

## Lyrics that actually resonate

The AI is only as good as the words you feed it. A few principles:

**Be specific, not vague**
- Instead of "I feel sad" → "I'm staring at your contact, thumb hovering over delete"
- Instead of "Life is hard" → "Three cups of coffee and I still can't focus"

**Use sensory details**
- Sounds: "the hum of the refrigerator"
- Visuals: "orange streetlight through the blinds"
- Physical: "cold feet on bathroom tiles"

**Tell a story in the chorus**
The best hooks aren't just emotions — they're moments. "We were dancing in the kitchen at 2am" beats "I love you so much."

## My current workflow

1. Write lyrics in a text editor first — don't compose in Suno's box
2. Add structure tags
3. Write a detailed style prompt (50-100 words). Use the template above if you blank
4. Generate 4-5 variations
5. Extend the best one
6. Use inpainting to fix weak sections

## The uncanny valley

AI music has a "tell" — everything is slightly too perfect, too polished. Sometimes I intentionally add imperfection cues:

- "slightly out of tune"
- "live room sound"
- "tape hiss"
- "human timing"

These make the output feel more organic.

## Is this cheating?

I was a bedroom producer before AI tools existed. I spent years learning DAWs, sound design, mixing. Some might say AI generation cheapens music creation.

I see it differently. It's a new instrument. The creative decisions — what to say, what mood to create, what story to tell — are still mine. Suno handles the execution, I handle the vision.

And honestly? It's fun. I've made more music in the last six months than in the previous six years of traditional production.

## Where this ends up for me

I use AI tools as a fast sketchpad. Some of the results I release under Caspian Ghost — Russian lyrics, because it makes it more personal.

What's your experience with AI music tools? I'm always looking to swap prompt strategies.
