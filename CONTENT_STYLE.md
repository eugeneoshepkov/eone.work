## House style

- Write like you talk. Short sentences. Occasional fragments. No fluff.
- Open with a hook + a clear promise in the first 3–6 lines.
- Prefer specifics over abstractions: constraints, tradeoffs, failure modes, examples, numbers when you have them.
- Keep paragraphs short (1–3 sentences). Use lists when density goes up.
- Use headings that state a claim, not a topic.
- Add code only when it buys clarity. Keep snippets minimal and copy-pastable.
- Avoid filler phrases like “in this post”, “let’s dive in”, “here’s what I learned”.
- Close with a takeaway + an invite (question, next step, or how to reach you).

## Frontmatter rules (parser-friendly)

- Keep values single-line.
- `tags` must be `[a, b, c]` (no multiline YAML).
- Tags use canonical casing (`TypeScript`, `React`, `Engineering`, `Design`, `AI`, `PostgreSQL`, `OpenAI`, `LLMs`, `SDK`, `npm`).
- `featured` is `true` or `false`.
- `date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
